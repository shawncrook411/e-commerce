## Description
This is a basic test project to use the sequelize npm package. It allows you to create a database, and then access it with various express API routes. You can create/update/delete/and get all/any categories/tags or products of your ecommerce website. There's not currently an actual webpage associated with it so all requests must be done in a program like insomnia 

Starter code was contributed by the BootCampSpot, they created the basic express frameworks. I created the models and routes for link with sequelize
## Installation
To install, clone the repo onto your computer. Then using MYSQL you must SOURCE from the db/schema.sql file. After run the command 'npm run seed' which will automatically create  and seed all the tables into your database. From there run 'npm start' to start the server and then it should be live and ready to go! 
## Usage
To use, have the server running and then you can access it with HTTP requests from insomnia. All routes go through localhost:3001/api/ to begin with and from there you will have to find which routes you want to use. You can create, delete, get and update any product / tag or category
